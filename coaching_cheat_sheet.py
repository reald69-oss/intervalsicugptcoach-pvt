    # ================== POLARISATION THRESHOLDS ==================
    # IMPORTANT SEMANTIC NOTE:
    # - "Polarisation" (power-based) follows the Seiler ratio definition:
    #     (Z1 + Z3) / (2 × Z2)
    #   Canonical Seiler polarisation requires ≥ 1.0.
    #   Green / amber ranges below are *heuristic coaching bands* for weekly feedback,
    #   not strict physiological definitions.
    #
    # - "PolarisationIndex" is a normalized 0–1 power-only index (Z1+Z2 share),
    #   interpreted contextually by training phase.
    #
    # - "Polarisation_fused" and "Polarisation_combined" are normalized intensity
    #   distribution indices derived using Seiler / Stöggl / Issurin methodology.
    #   Their green / amber bands represent polarised vs pyramidal vs threshold-dominant
    #   patterns at the *weekly* level (not session-level judgments).

    # 🧠 SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED PHASE DETECTION (v17.4)
    # ================================================================
    # These PhaseBoundaries are based on:
    # - Banister et al. (1975–1991): Impulse-Response Model (CTL/ATL → TSB)
    # - Mujika & Padilla (2003, 2010): Tapering and Performance Maintenance
    # - Seiler (2010, 2020): Endurance Intensity Distribution (Base/Build/Peak)
    # - Issurin (2008): Block Periodisation Model
    # - Friel (2009): Practical endurance periodisation framework
    #
    # In this model:
    #   trend_min / trend_max  → week-to-week % change in training load (TSS)
    #   acwr_max               → acute:chronic workload ratio (ATL/CTL) ceiling
    #   lvi_min                 → Load Variability Index (fatigue balance) floor
    #
    # These values align with both academic sources and Intervals.icu's
    # TSB (Training Stress Balance) fatigue-freshness mapping:
    #     transition: [10, 999]   → very fresh / detraining
    #     fresh: [5, 10]          → race-ready
    #     grey: [-5, 5]           → balanced / neutral
    #     optimal: [-30, -5]      → productive fatigue
    #     high_risk: [-999, -30]  → overreached
